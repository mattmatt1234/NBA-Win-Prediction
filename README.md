# NBA-Win-Prediction
This project is meant for me to learn and practice my skills in classification models. In my Logistic Regression Project
I use a heatmap to analyze the features with the greatest correlation to wins for feature selection (features that will be useful for my model).
I then validate these features by creating various charts to see the effects that these features have on wins. I used varied ammounts of feaure variables
in order to test the accuracy of my model changes. I then used a Random Forest in order to see if it would produce more accurate results, and it did. 
One limitation that I do see with this project and would like to explore with more is that because this data was taken from over 30 years of NBA game 
data, there are features that will be more (or less) mportant based on time. For example, three pointers made/attempted would not be nearly as important 30 
years ago, as it would be five years ago.
